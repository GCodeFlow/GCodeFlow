# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is GCodeFlow and I’m 15 years old. I’m learning to program with Python and I want to become a tech freelance consultant.  
This profile collects my progress, my projects, and everything I’m building day by day.

## What I’m studying

- Python for automation and scraping
- Flask to create simple web apps
- Git and GitHub to collaborate and share code

## Goals by the end of 2025

- Publish useful and working projects
- Build a technical portfolio to showcase online
- Learn other languages like JavaScript and SQL
- Get ready to work as a freelance consultant in 2026

## Current projects

- Python calculator
- Secure password generator
- Script that analyzes .txt files
- Mini web app with Flask

All projects will be updated and improved over time. This space is a way to document what I’m learning and share it with anyone who wants to follow my journey.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I’m building slowly — one project at a time.
